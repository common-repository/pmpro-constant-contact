THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED

== Description ==

This plugin was developed to support an older version of the third-party API and will not work with the latest version of Constant Contact. We are keeping it here for archive reasons and in case future development occurs. If you would like to add a vote to have this worked on, please use our [contact form](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/contact/). As an alternative, you can consider using the [Zapier Integration for Paid Memberships Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pmpro-zapier/).
